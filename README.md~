Sleng Teng is the name given to one of the first fully computerized riddims, influential in Jamaican music. The riddim, which was created by the collaboration between King Jammy and Wayne Smith, was titled "Under Mi Sleng Teng" in 1984. Wayne Smith found the computerized sound in Noel Davey's keyboard, and together he and Davey arranged the riddim, slowed it down, matched it to Smith's key, and rehearsed on it with lyrics inspired by Barrington Levy's "Under Mi Sensi" and Yellowman's "Under me fat ting",[1] before taking it to Jammy's studio in late 1984.
